When active editor is opening a below controller,\n```ruby\nclass UsersController < ApplicationController\n  \n  layout 'user_dashboard'\n  \nend\n```\nFirst, cursor is on the `layout` method, `open-layout` opens `app/views/layouts/user_dashboard.html.erb` if it exists.\n\nSecond, when cursor isn't on the `layout` method, it opens `app/views/layouts/users.html.erb` if it doesn't exist, opens `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb`.\n\nThe first behavior has a priority to apply.\n\n### open-helper\nIt opens related helper from `controller`, `model`, `view`, `helper-test` or `helper-spec`.\n\ne.g. When active editor is opening: \n\n`app/controllers/users_controller.rb`, `app/models/user.rb`, `app/views/users/*.html.erb` or `spec/helpers/users_helper_spec.rb`,\n\n`open-helper` opens `app/helpers/users_helper.rb`.\n\nIf no helper found, show dialog to create new file.\n\n\n### open-test\nIt opens related test from `controller`, `model`, `helper` or `factory`.\n\ne.g. When active editor is opening: \n\n`app/controllers/users_controller.rb`, it opens `spec/controllers/users_controller_test.rb`.\n\n`app/models/user.rb`, it opens `test/models/user_test.rb`.\n\n`app/helpers/users_helper.rb`, it opens `test/helpers/users_helper_test.rb`.\n\nIf no test found, show dialog to create new file.\n\n\n### open-spec\nIt opens related spec from `controller`, `model`, `helper` or `factory`.\n\ne.g. When active editor is opening: \n\n`app/controllers/users_controller.rb`, it opens `spec/controllers/users_controller_spec.rb`, feautres or requests spec.\n\n`app/models/user.rb` or `spec/factories/users.rb`, it opens `spec/models/user_spec.rb`.\n\n`app/helpers/users_helper.rb`, it opens `spec/helpers/users_helper_spec.rb`.\n\n\n\nIf no spec found, show dialog to create new file.\n\n### open-partial-template\nIt opens partial template from `render` method.\n\ne.g. When active editor is opening a below view file and cursor is on the `render` method,\n```ruby\n<section id=\"contents\">\n\n<%= render 'sidebar' %>\n\n</section>\n```\n`open-partial-template` opens `app/views/users/_sidebar.html.erb`.\n\nIf no related view found, show dialog to create new file.\n\n### open-asset\nIt opens related asset file from view or asset file.\n\ne.g. \n* When active editor is opening a below view,\n```html\n<html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<%= stylesheet_link_tag \"user\" %>\n<%= javascript_include_tag \"user\" %>\n<%= csrf_meta_tags %>\n</head>\n<body>\n<%= yield %>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\nwhen cursor is on `javascript_include_tag` method, it opens `app/assets/javascripts/user.js`,\nwhen cursor is on `stylesheet_link_tag` method, it opens `app/assets/stylesheets/user.css`.\n\n* When it is opening a asset file as following and cursor is on the `require` method,\n```coffee\n//= require my_library\n```\nit opens javascript file if it exists.\n\n* When it is opening a asset file as following and cursor is on the `require_tree` or `require_directory` method,\n```coffee\n//= require_tree shared\n//= require_directory shared\n```\nit opens related asset file list\n![](http://cl.ly/image/1G2D240f1A0i/application01_js_-__Users_hakutoitoi__ghq_github_com_hmatsuda_rails-transporter_spec_fixtures_-_Atom.png)\n\n### open-mingration-finder\nIt opens all of migration list.\n![](http://cl.ly/image/3y0F2D1H1w2F/application01_js_-__Users_hakutoitoi__ghq_github_com_hmatsuda_rails-transporter_spec_fixtures_-_Atom.png)\n\n### open-factory\nIt opens related factory file from `model` or `model-spec`.\n\ne.g. When active editor is opening: \n\n`app/models/user.rb`, or `spec/models/user_spec.rb`,\n\n`open-spec` opens `spec/factories/blogs.rb`.\n\nIf no factory found, show dialog to create new file.\n\n## Default Keymaps\nCommand | Keymap\n--------|-------\nopen-controller|`ctrl-r c`\nopen-view-finder|`ctrl-r v f`\nopen-view|`ctrl-r v`\nopen-layout|`ctrl-r l`\nopen-model|`ctrl-r m`\nopen-helper|`ctrl-r h`\nopen-spec|`ctrl-r s`\nopen-partial-template|`ctrl-r p`\nopen-asset|`ctrl-r a`\nopen-migration-finder|`ctrl-r d m`\nopen-factory|`ctrl-r f`\n\n## Configurations\n\nYou can change these from the Settings menu.\n\n- `newFileExtention`: Extension of the view files.
